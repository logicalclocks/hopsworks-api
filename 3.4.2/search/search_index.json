Public Api such as metadata objects and public REST Api implementations should be fully documented with defaults. Setup and Build Documentation # We use mkdocs together with mike ( for versioning ) to build the documentation and a plugin called keras-autodoc to auto generate Python API documentation from docstrings. Background about mike : mike builds the documentation and commits it as a new directory to the gh-pages branch. Each directory corresponds to one version of the documentation. Additionally, mike maintains a json in the root of gh-pages with the mappings of versions/aliases for each of the directories available. With aliases you can define extra names like dev or latest , to indicate stable and unstable releases. Currently we are using our own version of keras-autodoc pip install git+https://github.com/moritzmeister/keras-autodoc@split-tags-properties Install HOPSWORKS with docs extras: pip install -e . [ dev,docs ] To build the docs, first run the auto doc script: cd .. python auto_doc.py Option 1: Build only current version of docs # Either build the docs, or serve them dynamically: Note: Links and pictures might not resolve properly later on when checking with this build. The reason for that is that the docs are deployed with versioning on docs.hopsworks.ai and therefore another level is added to all paths, e.g. docs.hopsworks.ai/[version-or-alias] . Using relative links should not be affected by this, however, building the docs with version (Option 2) is recommended. mkdocs build # or mkdocs serve Option 2 (Preferred): Build multi-version doc with mike # Versioning on docs.hopsworks.ai # On docs.hopsworks.ai we implement the following versioning scheme: current master branches (e.g. of hopsworks corresponding to master of Hopsworks): rendered as current Hopsworks snapshot version, e.g. 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT [dev] , where dev is an alias to indicate that this is an unstable version. the latest release: rendered with full current version, e.g. 3.0.1 [latest] with latest alias to indicate that this is the latest stable release. previous stable releases: rendered without alias, e.g. 3.0.0 . Build Instructions # For this you can either checkout and make a local copy of the upstream/gh-pages branch, where mike maintains the current state of docs.hopsworks.ai, or just build documentation for the branch you are updating: Building one branch: Checkout your dev branch with modified docs: git checkout [ dev-branch ] Generate API docs if necessary: python auto_doc.py Build docs with a version and alias mike deploy [ version ] [ alias ] --update-alias # for example, if you are updating documentation to be merged to master, # which will become the new SNAPSHOT version: mike deploy 3 .1.0-SNAPSHOT dev --update-alias # if you are updating docs of the latest stable release branch mike deploy [ version ] latest --update-alias # if you are updating docs of a previous stable release branch mike deploy [ version ] If no gh-pages branch existed in your local repository, this will have created it. Important : If no previous docs were built, you will have to choose a version as default to be loaded as index, as follows mike set-default [ version-or-alias ] You can now checkout the gh-pages branch and serve: git checkout gh-pages mike serve You can also list all available versions/aliases: mike list Delete and reset your local gh-pages branch: mike delete --all # or delete single version mike delete [ version-or-alias ] Adding new API documentation # To add new documentation for APIs, you need to add information about the method/class to document to the auto_doc.py script: PAGES = { \"connection.md\" : [ \"hopsworks.connection.Connection.connection\" ] \"new_template.md\" : [ \"module\" , \"xyz.asd\" ] } Now you can add a template markdown file to the docs/templates directory with the name you specified in the auto-doc script.
