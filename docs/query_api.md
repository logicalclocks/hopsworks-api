# Query

Query objects are strictly generated by HSFS APIs called on [`FeatureGroup`][hsfs.feature_group.FeatureGroup] objects.
Users will never construct a Query object using the constructor of the class.
For this reason we do not provide the full documentation of the class here.

::: hsfs.constructor.query.Query
